    "### Syllabus Day - Day 1\n",
    "#### Introduction to R & COVID-19\n",
    "Date: 1/4/2021\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have a stats background, **leave now.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Several awkward introductions later.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets\n",
    "For **lecture**: COVID Isolation on Sleep and Health in Healthcare Workers (SHHW) data\n",
    "\n",
    "For **lab**: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) data for COVID-19\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SHHW\n",
    "Asks 29 questions about participants' background, and a variety of health-related and work information\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducted from end of March 2020 to end of April 2020\n",
    "Sample size, $N=849$\n",
    "\n",
    "Study was conducted to determine mood changes of in-person vs. remote healthcare workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:** Mood worsens across healthcare workers, regardless of whether they work in-person or at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the 29 questions serves as its own variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### KAP\n",
    "KAP survey asks >100 questions about the participant's background, health-related knowledge, and behavioral practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size $N \\approx 5485$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validity\n",
    "Talking about validity, its different types, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The major task of any science is the development of a theory ... that explains\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hawthorne Effect Experiment\n",
    "Early psychological experiment to determine the impact of working conditions on worker productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there was a confounding variable: workers who were being observed always were more productive\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enter validity\n",
    "Validity means essentially truth or correctnessâ€”a correspondence between a proposition describing how things work and how they actually work\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defn**: The *validity* of a test or procedure describes the extent to which it measures the phenomenon it's supposed to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Four types of validity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical conclusion validity:** About the correlation (covariance) between the predictor and the outcome\n",
    "- Does the relationship exist?\n",
    "- Strictly correlational: non-causal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal validity:** About whether the observed covariation between A (presumed predictor) and B (presumed outcome) actually reflects a causal relationship $A \\rightarrow B$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Construct validity:** About the higher-order constructs that represent sampling particulars\n",
    "- Given that there is a valid causal relationship, is our interpretation about the construct responsible for that causation reasonable?\n",
    "\n",
    "**External validity:** Whether the cause-effect relationship holds over variation in persons, settings, treatment variables, and measurement variables.\n",
    "- Roughly, generalizability: do our results generalize outside of this experimental setting?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Threats to different types of validity\n",
    "Threats to **statistical conclusion validity**: reasons why inferences about covariation between two variables may be incorrect\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g., number of kids & anxiety during COVID\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Low statistical power\n",
    "    - Low power might arise from small sample size, for example\n",
    "    - Lower sensitivity, in a sense; we won't be able to detect true correlations because of an insufficient sample size\n",
    "    - More on this on days 3 and 4\n",
    "2. Violated assumptions of statistical tests\n",
    "    - It might just be inappropriate to use the tests we try\n",
    "3. Unreliability of measures\n",
    "    - Measures of anxiety, for example, might have a low level of reliability\n",
    "        - Asking participants to self-report these things is notoriously unreliable\n",
    "4. Restriction of range\n",
    "    - What if we pose the question as \"0 kids\", \"1-3 kids\", \"3+ kids\"\n",
    "    - Sometimes misgrouping when you turn a numerical variable into a categorical one is dangerous\n",
    "5. Unreliability of treatment implementation\n",
    "    - The experimenters don't apply treatments reliably\n",
    "6. Heterogeneity of units\n",
    "    - Different conditions for each experimental unit (subject) that confound our results\n",
    "    \n",
    "Threats to **internal validity:** reasons why the causal assessment may be incorrect\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., sleep hours & anxiety in COVID\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ambiguous temporal precedence\n",
    "    - Causes always precede effects\n",
    "    - A lack of clarity about which variable \"occurs\" first\n",
    "2. Selection\n",
    "    - Some factor impacts what kind of respondents we get\n",
    "    - Confounded by some external factor\n",
    "3. History\n",
    "    - Confounded by some event happening in subjects' history\n",
    "    - E.g., subject loses a job during sleep study, causes stress\n",
    "4. Maturation\n",
    "    - Naturally occurring changes over time\n",
    "    - Maybe people just get better at sleeping with anxiety over time\n",
    "5. Attrition\n",
    "    - Missing data :(\n",
    "    - How do we deal with missing values in our dataset?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Threats to **construct validity**: reasons why the interpretation the constructs involved may be incorrect\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experimenter-bias effect\n",
    "    - Need to consider the experimenter's own preconceived notions when the study isn't conducted in a blind fashion\n",
    "2. Unintended by-products of the treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "Threats to **external validity:** reasons why the findings might not be generalizable\n",
    "1. Heterogeneity and representativeness of the sample\n",
    "    - Maybe your sample just doesn't stand in for the greater population\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Reading activity\n",
    "Flying phobia treatment study\n",
    "\n",
    "Some issues with the study:\n",
    "- People with severe flight anxiety self-selected out (by quitting after panicking), so the study might not generalize to all people with flight phobias.\n",
    "- Participants might feel pressured to report favorable results after all the work they were put through.\n",
    "- The second time around on the posttest, participants knew for sure that the plane would not actually take off in the simulation.\n",
    "- Small sample\n",
    "- People who think their anxiety is treatable self-select in \n",
    "- Not clear if pre-flight anxiety is actually a good indicator\n",
    "- Anxiety criterion is standardized on college students, and participants in the study seem to be a good deal older\n",
    "- Participants who felt the therapy wasn't working self-selected out by leaving the study \n",
    "- The first experience might be artificially high-anxiety because of the panicking subjects (who were absent for the posttest)\n",
    "- Study claims to be comparative, but ends by making claims about blanket effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "In general: *missing data* can introduce bias if there are different rates of missing data across groups.\n",
    "Abstracts that reveal researcher expectations can be dangerous."
