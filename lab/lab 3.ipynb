    "### lab 3 - effect size, power, missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A simple regression\n",
    "$Y = b_0 + b_1X + e$ (note the added error term, $e$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "- $H_0 : b_1 = 0$ ( are these supposed to be $\\beta$ ?)\n",
    "- $H_1 : b_1 \\ne 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample size problem\n",
    "Statistical significance vs. how big the effect of the predictor is\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we randomly take a large national sample of COVID patients and discover their IQ is 101. We also randomly collect a sample of non-COVID Americans whose mean IQ is 101.33. Is this a significant difference? Does it represent a breakthrough finding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, suppose the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "For COVID:\n",
    "$$ n_1 = 50000 \\\\ \\bar{Y}_1 = 101 \\\\ s^2_1 = 225 $$\n",
    "For non-COVID:\n",
    "$$ n_2 = 50000 \\\\ \\bar{Y}_2 = 101.33 \\\\ s^2_2 = 225 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We conduct a t-test, and we conclude that there is a statistically significant difference. ($p << 0.05$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Sample size problem:\" a large sample size allows us to conclude a statistically significant result that is practically insignificant\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R example\n",
    "Cynthia shows us linear model, with some minor random noise. But the `lm` function only detects statistically significant relationships for sample sizes of $N \\approx 50$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $N$ we need to pick up on some relationship varies with the scale of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces some ambiguity; sometimes, it's unclear whether a statistically significant relationship is the result of a practically significant phenomenon or just a large sample size. For this reason, the consensus has shifted toward stating the results of a hypothesis test alongside an indication of the magnitude of an effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect size can be stated as a direct difference, or it can be normalized with respect to standard deviation. For example: comparing the means of two groups, an unstandardized effect size would be $\\mu_2 - \\mu_1$, and a standardized effect size is $\\frac{\\mu_2 - \\mu_1}{\\sigma}$, where $\\sigma$ is the common standard deviation between the two groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effect size for linear regression\n",
    "For linear regression, Cohen suggets an effect size $f^2$:\n",
    "$$ f^2 = \\frac{R^2}{1-R^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to compare extended vs. reduced models, we compute the effect size as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f^2 = \\frac{R^2_{full}-R^2_{reduced}}{1-R^2_{full}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical power analysis\n",
    "- Statistical power analysis helps us decide how large of a sample is needed to detect a certain effect reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "|              | $H_0$ true    | $H_0$ false   |\n",
    "|--------------|---------------|---------------|\n",
    "| Don't reject $H_0$ | True positive | Type II error |\n",
    "| Reject $H_0$ | Type I error  | True negative |\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{Type I error}) = P(\\text{false positive}) = P(p < \\alpha | H_0 \\text{ true})$$\n",
    "$$P(\\text {Type II error}) = P(\\text{false negative}) = P(p > \\alpha | H_0 \\text{ false})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factors influencing power\n",
    "- Sample size\n",
    "- Significance level\n",
    "- True value of the thing we're testing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing data\n",
    "- Missing data are the norm, not the exception\n",
    "- Missing data means we lose informationâ€”and therefore precision\n",
    "- And missing data can introduce bias depending on \"how\" the data went missing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is it missing?\n",
    "- MAR - Missing at random\n",
    "    - Missingness is related to the observed data, but not due to the missing data or the latent variables.\n",
    "- MCAR - Missing completely at random\n",
    "    - Data are missing for reasons unrelated to the observed data, missing data, or latent variables.\n",
    "    - Observed data can be treated as a random sample of the complete data.\n",
    "- MNAR - Missing not at random\n",
    "    - Missing data is due to unmeasured/unobsered variables\n",
    "    - We can't account for which data is missing\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Choosing which mechanism\n",
    "MCAR vs MAR **can be distinguished**: we fit a logistic regression model with DV binary Missing or NotMissing at time step $t$ and IV all the variables collected up until $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we can treat missing data as MCAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Takeaways\n",
    "- We can't simply delete missing cases\n",
    "- Effect size and statistical power analysis are important\n"
