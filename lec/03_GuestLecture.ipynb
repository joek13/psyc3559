    "### Guest Lecture - Dr. West and Dr. Aiken\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Suffice to say, Dr. West and Dr. Aiken are very accomplished.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation: Three Applications of Regression Analysis: Description, Prediction, Explanation/Model Building\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Regression\n",
    "1. Predictor variables — continuous or categorical\n",
    "    a. individual differences — personality traits, sex, religion\n",
    "    b. experimental treatments (e.g., placebo, 1 dose of vax, 2 doses of vax)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Dependent (criterion) variable\n",
    "    a. Typically a continuous variable (college GPA, reaction time)\n",
    "    b. Other forms of DV — extensions of regression\n",
    "        - binary: e.g., alive or dead\n",
    "        - ordered categories\n",
    "        - counts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Relationship between independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear relationship: $\\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1X$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Three topics\n",
    "- Description — summarize relationships graphically or in terms of equation\n",
    "- Prediction — predict a future value for a person based on prior regression equation and this person's predictor values\n",
    "- Explanation — prior theory and research are used to build a regression model, then tested against the data\n",
    "\n",
    "These three applications are distinct, but can often be related.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "The goal: to simply summarize relationships in the data—graphically or mathematically\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: weight vs. height,sex (linear relationship)\n",
    "\n",
    "Yerkes-Dodson Law: Curvilinear relationship (performance peaks at some mid level of stress, decreases in either direction)\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID Data:\n",
    "- Issue 1: Data is discrete and can't be treated as a function\n",
    "    - Answer: LOWESS smooths data and makes a continuous function\n",
    "- Issue 2: we need more than one model to represent data\n",
    "    - Answer: splines\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Prediction\n",
    "- Use dataset to develop regression equation\n",
    "- Predict future cases using regression equation and measured predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model building\n",
    "The goal: build a model that predicts odds of mask-wearing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some predictors:\n",
    "- **Conscientiousness:** personality measure; the tendency to be careful, self-disciplined, rule-following\n",
    "- **Perceived Susceptibility:** health beliefs & health protective behavior; belief about whether we are susceptible\n",
    "- **Perceived Benefits:** health beliefs; belief about whether an intervention is beneficial\n",
    "\n",
    "Some criteria and their appropriate models:\n",
    "- Continuous criterion: OLS regression\n",
    "- Binary criterion: logistic regression, probit regression\n",
    "- Count criterion: poission regression, negative binomial regression\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we evaluate models?\n",
    "Look at your $R^2$ for the mupltiple regression model. $R^2$, the coefficient of determination, corresponds with the proportion of variation in our criterion explained by our predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our $R^2_{multiple} = R^2_{Y,\\hat{Y}}$ — the correlation between our predictor and observed variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 1: Does conscientiousness explain differences in mask wearing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 2: Do health beliefs about susceptibility explain difference in mask wearing, above and beyond conscientiousness?\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, very dangerous diseases for which there are no cure show a curvilinear relationship with respect to health beliefs: people would rather just not know they have breast cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step: try to replicate model on other datasets; see if predictions are borne out\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we find that our hypothesis about curvilinear relationships w/r/t susceptibility aren't borne out. We take the squared term out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intervention\n",
    "Can we intervene by increasing perceived susceptibility to COVID and perceived benefits of mask-wearing?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we quantify the effect of our intervention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's conduct 2x2 ANOVA on this: does the test work, and for whom does it work? Only people who score high on conscientiousness? etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition: let's just cut conscientiousness at the median into high/low conscientiousness groups\n",
    "\n",
    "**NO, NO, NO... this is bad**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous variable interaction:** develop a new regression equation that uses a binary variable to indicate whether the "

    "#### Questions\n",
    "- Why manually pick the degrees for our terms instead of, say, letting that be a parameter of the model?\n",
    "    - Answer: overfitting, and the philosophical desire to have good reasons for the features (predictors) you pick\n"
